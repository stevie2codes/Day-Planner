# Day-Planner

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## How it works

The app will display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).
Each time slot will represent one hour and contain the following:

- The time
- A field to hold user input
- A save button
- A clear button
  Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- BootStrap
- JavaScript
- Jquery
- Moment.JS

## What I learned

Utilizing the "this" keyword was a breakthrough for me in order
to get this project working properly. Storing multiple inputs into local storage was a hurdle for me as well. Learning the shortend syntax of jquery has started to become easier after this project. Ive found that at the very beginning of a project, laying out your HTML with clear identifiers can be a huge factor in the flow of the DOM manipulation process.
